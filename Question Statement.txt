Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the sum of minimum and maximum elements in the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {-2, 1, -4, 5, 3}
Output: 1
Explanation: min = -4, max =  5. Sum = -4 + 5 = 1



Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
A[]  = {1, 3, 4, 1}
Output: 5
Explanation: min = 1, max = 4. Sum = 1 + 4 = 5
